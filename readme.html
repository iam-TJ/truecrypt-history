<H1><A NAME="Introduction">1. Introduction</A></H1>
<P>Welcome to the source distribution of E4M. This document briefly describes how to build E4M.</P>
<P>Firstly E4M does not use the build tool supplied by Microsoft in the NT DDK.</P>
<P>E4M uses normal makefiles to build everything.</P>
<P>Extract the files from the zip archive, with &quot;use directories&quot; set on. The source zip contains long names so don't use an older pkunzip.</P>
<P>For the rest of this document I will assume you installed it into &quot;C:\e4m&quot;, but this can be any directory. If you pick another directory just replace &quot;C:\e4m&quot; in the documentation with whatever you like.</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="What you will need">2. What you will need</A></H1>
<OL>
<LI>A compiler, which can be VC4.x, VC5.0, VC6.0 or later
<LI>The NT DDK</OL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Setup the DDK path">3. Setup the DDK path</A></H1>
<P>In the device drivers makefile, change the variable DDK to the full path of your ddk directory, normally c:\ddk</P>
<H2><A NAME="If you plan to debug the driver">3.1. If you plan to debug the driver</A></H2>
<P>If you plan to debug the product you will need:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Two computers and a serial cable (laplink cable)
<LI>The Win32 SDK, or WinDbg alone, which can be downloaded from Microsoft
<LI>The checked build of Widows NT installed on the second computer</OL>
<H2><A NAME="If you want to modify the help files">3.2. If you want to modify the help files</A></H2>
<OL>
<LI>SDF <A HREF="http://www.mincom.com/mtr/sdf/resources/index.html">http://www.mincom.com/mtr/sdf/resources/index.html</A>
<LI>any text editor
<LI>any Microsoft help compiler</OL>
<H2><A NAME="If you want to modify the setup program">3.3. If you want to modify the setup program</A></H2>
<OL>
<LI>InstallShield 5.0 professional or the &quot;Free&quot; Edition which comes with Visual C++.
<LI>PackageForTheWeb which creates self extracting archives for distribution.</OL>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>The Debug format changed between VC4.x and VC5.0. To debug using VC5.0 or later you must download a new WinDbg from Microsoft. With an older VC4.x, try the WinDbg from an old Win32 SDK CD.

<LI>run &quot;c:\progra~1\devstudio\vc\bin\vcvars32.bat&quot; or &quot;vcvars32 x86&quot; for VC4.x this sets up the search path's for your compiler
<LI>run &quot;nmake&quot; or &quot;nmake RELEASE=1&quot;</OL>
<P>You should end up with e4mnt4.sys in the ntdriver directory.</P>
