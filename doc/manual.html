<H1><A NAME="Introduction">1. Introduction</A></H1>
<P>E4M is an on-the-fly disk encryption product.</P>
<P>The product supports either the file hosted volumes style transparent encryption, or raw partition encryption.</P>
<P>The way this works is you create a volume on your hard disk, CDROM, floppy or other media which is essentially just a normal file. The file however is in fact a file system itself. It contains all the structures needed by your operating system to recognise the file as a file system of a particular type such as FAT or NTFS. This is the file hosted volumes style volume.</P>
<P>Or you could choose a blank or unwanted partition on a local hard disk or floppy disks and format it using E4M. You can then mount this new encrypted volume, and use it like you would any other drive. This method is refered to as Raw partition volumes.</P>
<P>The only difference is that Raw partition volumes do not have a file system in the middle, so they provide an encrypted file system on top of a Raw partition. As opposed to file hosted volumes which need an existing file system to &quot;host&quot; the volume file. An example would be a E4M volume called &quot;myfiles.vol&quot; located in &quot;C:\&quot;, rather than the same volume located on the second partition of your hard disk.</P>
<P>To your operating system, these new volumes will work exactly like &quot;C:\&quot; or any other drive on your system.</P>
<P>Tools are provided to &quot;mount&quot; a volume, and to create a volume. The process of mounting a volume involves pretending that the volume file or partition is in fact a removable media device attached to your system.</P>
<P>Thanks for using my product, and enjoy!</P>

<H1><A NAME="What\'s New in this Version">3. What's New in this Version</A></H1>
<UL>
<LI>Support for Pkcs-5 key setting via either HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1. The Pkcs-5 code is self testing, and tests itself against HMAC and Pkcs-5 test vectors.
<LI>Support for new ciphers including IDEA, 3 key triple-DES, CAST and Blowfish.
<LI>Support for Scramdisk file hosted volumes using all of Scramdisk’s ciphers except the &quot;summer&quot; cipher.
<LI>A new command line tool &quot;voltest&quot; has been provided which dumps the headers (E4M only) of a particular volume, and tests the particular volumes sector encryption, optionally you can display individual sectors with this tool.
<LI>Support for changing volume passwords has been added.
<LI>The user interface for mounting a volume has been rewritten to be more user friendly.
<LI>Passwords can now be cached in the driver (and cleared at the users request).
<LI>The History information is now more robust, the history operates a MRU list of the last 8 volumes mounted.
<LI>The mount program now shows the full path name of a mounted volume when a mounted drive letter is selected.
<LI>Support for MDCSHA is now not available for new volumes. Only <EM>SFS</EM> uses this cipher.
<LI>Some of the cursor handling in the format wizard has been cleaned up, the wizard now correctly displays the hour glass cursor at the correct times.
<LI>The FAT formatting code has been rewritten to drop the GPL’d code, this means this product no longer ships under the GNU GPL.
<LI>The format GUI now shows the user what’s going on with the random code. Random bytes, and the selected key bytes are displayed to the user.
<LI>The documentation system now uses <EM>SDF</EM> which allows different document formats to be used such as Windows <EM>hlp</EM>, and <EM>html</EM>.</UL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="How to Create a Volume">4. How to Create a Volume</A></H1>
<P>To create a volume file you will need to click on the icon &quot;Create Volume&quot;.</P>
<P>The program &quot;volformat&quot; should start, and will have the title &quot;Create E4M Volume&quot;.</P>
<P>You should see the following wizard.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="format.gif"></P>
<P>There are six steps in creating a volume:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Step 1 Select Volume Type
<LI>Step 2 Pick Volume Location
<LI>Step 3 Set Encryption Options
<LI>Step 4 Specify Volume Size
<LI>Step 5 Choose a Password
<LI>Step 6 Generate the Volume</OL>
<H2><A NAME="Step 1 Select Volume Type">4.1. Step 1 Select Volume Type</A></H2>
<P>Choose a type for your volume. The format or type of your volume can be either one of the following formats:</P>
<UL>
<LI>E4M
<LI>SFS</UL>
<P>You should only use SFS is you want to be able to use your volumes in DOS, Windows 3.x or Windows 95/98.</P>
<P>SFS format is slightly more efficient than the E4M format. SFS volumes have exactly 512 more bytes than E4M. This is because E4M needs a header sector and a boot sector. SFS uses the boot sector for its header, and then needs E4M to fake the boot sector for it at run time. Which directly gives rise to the following important limitation:</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Warning: </STRONG>Never reformat an SFS volume using format.com, explorer or any other tool. SFS volumes cannot be formatted. If you accidentally reformat an SFS volume, the volume will be corrupted.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<P>E4M volumes can be reformatted freely using either FAT or NTFS without any limitations.</P>
<P>Once you have selected a volume type, the &quot;Next&quot; button will be enabled and you can proceed to the next step.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Step 2 Pick Volume Location">4.2. Step 2 Pick Volume Location</A></H2>
<P>Select where on your system the volume is to reside, you should click the &quot;Browse Files&quot; button or the &quot;Raw Devices&quot; button to choose the location for the new volume.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Unlike some products, E4M does not provide a field for you to type in a descriptive name for your volume; instead simply use long filenames if you are using file hosted volumes.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<P>Once you have picked a location for your volume, the &quot;Next&quot; button will be enabled and you can proceed to the next step.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Step 3 Set Encryption Options">4.3. Step 3 Set Encryption Options</A></H2>
<P>Select the type of encryption you want for your volume.</P>
<P>You can choose one of the listed ciphers.</P>
<P>You must also choose either HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1 for use with Pkcs-5.</P>
<P>If you are creating a legacy volume such as SFS, no Pkcs-5 is used.</P>
<P>Once you have picked the cipher of your choice, the &quot;Next&quot; button will be enabled and you can proceed to the next step.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Step 4 Specify Volume Size">4.4. Step 4 Specify Volume Size</A></H2>
<P>Please choose a reasonable size for your volume. There is a minimum and maximum size. The minimum size is 19KB, while the maximum size is 2GB.</P>
<P>If you type in an invalid size the wizard will not let you proceed to the next step.</P>
<P>If you are creating a volume on a Raw partition, the size edit box is disabled. This is because the size of the partition onto which your volume is created is set by whatever program you used to partition your drive (such as fdisk). The size is fixed and cannot be changed here. Simply click the &quot;Next&quot; button.</P>
<P>Once the system has a valid size for your volume. The wizard will enable the &quot;Next&quot; button and you can proceed to the next step.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Step 5 Choose a Password">4.5. Step 5 Choose a Password</A></H2>
<P>The system requires that you enter a password no shorter than 8 characters for E4M; and no shorter than 10 characters for SFS. SFS requires a complete phrase, this simply means a minimum of two words separated by a space which together are <U>no less</U> than 10 characters long.</P>
<P>Please be very careful when choosing your password. It should be picked carefully, please do not use any of the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A word found in any dictionary; even a word from an obscure language
<LI>A lyric from your favourite song
<LI>Your birthday; or your families birthday’s
<LI>The login password for your computer system
<LI>Your email password</UL>
<P>Examples of good passwords include words which include combinations of upper and lowercase letters, as well as punctuation and numbers.</P>
<P>Once you have selected a password, and typed it in twice for verification. The system will let you proceed to the final step by enabling the &quot;Next&quot; button.</P>
<H2><A NAME="Step 6 Generate the Volume">4.6. Step 6 Generate the Volume</A></H2>
<P>To complete the creation of your volume click the &quot;Finish&quot; button. There will be a short delay while your system is polled for some additional randomness which will be used in generating you volume.</P>
<P>Some products require that you move the mouse or type on the keyboard at this stage in order to generate randomness. E4M &quot;hooks&quot; the keyboard &amp; mouse from the very start of the volume creation wizard, every keyboard stroke and mouse movement is contributing to the &quot;randomness pool&quot;; this pool also includes the results of many various system calls. The aim of all of this is so that the system at this stage in the creation process has good quality randomness to create a unique volume key.</P>
<P>Once the key has been generated for you, and your new volume has been formatted, you should see a dialog giving you statistics about your volume. Once you see this dialog the entire creation process is complete, and the wizard will automatically exit.</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Mounting a Volume">5. Mounting a Volume</A></H1>
<P>The concept of &quot;mounting a volume&quot; means to make your operating system aware of the encrypted volume, which in turn allows you to read and write files to the volume, to defrag the volume, and to do everything else you would normally do to any other disk, even including formatting the volume.</P>
<P>To mount a volume, you will need to click on the icon &quot;Mount Volume&quot;. This will start the program &quot;volmount&quot;.</P>
<P>You should see the following window.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="mount.gif"></P>
<P>This window has the following elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tree view - which contains all of the driver letters available on your system, including the driver letters which have an encrypted volume attached to them in addition to free drive letters.
<LI>Volume to mount - this combo box contains a list of the last 8 volumes you mounted on your system, in addition there is an edit box which allows you to type in a volume name.
<LI>A Browse files button - this button allows you to select the volume you wish to mount by showing you a file selection dialog box.
<LI>A Raw devices button - as E4M supports volumes which are themselves actually disk partitions, the Raw devices button allows you to select which particular disk partition you want to mount, or select a floppy disk to mount. As Partitions, and floppy disk volumes require a special syntax, you would normally use this button to select one of these types of volumes.
<LI>Never save history - this check box allows you to retain maximum privacy by never storing the last 8 volumes you accessed, or any other program settings.
<LI>Password tab - this tab allows you to tell the system to attempt to mount an E4M volume, or a Scramdisk volume.
<LI>Password edit box - this field provides space for you to enter a volume password of up to 100 characters.
<LI>Password edit box (Scramdisk) - these 4 fields provide space for you to enter up to four 40 character passwords for use with Scramdisk.
<LI>Change button - this button allows you to change the volumes password, and will prompt you with the Change Password Window.
<LI>Cache in driver - this check box allows you to cache up to the last 4 passwords. What this means is that the device driver will try either the password you specify, or up to the last 4 passwords you had specified previously when mounting volumes (but only within you current Windows session as passwords are not stored on disk for security reasons).
<LI>Wipe Cache button - this button clears any passwords the driver has retained on your behalf in it's memory.
<LI>Mount - this button will pass everything on to the device driver, which will proceed to mount your volume.
<LI>Help - this button will open up the E4M help file.</UL>
<P>To mount a volume first select an available volume from the tree view, next type in a volume name, and a password, and finally press the mount button.</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Mount command line parameters">6. Mount command line parameters</A></H1>
<P>In order to make mounting a volume easier, such as automatically when a system starts up, or automatically when a particular program is run, extensive command line parameters have been provided which allow you to control the entire mount process, and any parameter or field present in the mount window. The mount parameters are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>/volume or /v  - allows you to enter a file and path name for the volume to be mounted.
<LI>/Scramdisk or /sd - this command switches to mounting in Scramdisk mode.
<LI>/letter or /l - allows you to specify which driver letter to attach the volume to.
<LI>/explore or /e  - opens an explorer window after a volume has been mounted.
<LI>/beep or /b - beeps after a volume has been mounted.
<LI>/password or /p - specifies the password to be used with the volume in /v.
<LI>/password2 or /p2 - specifies the password to be used with the volume in /v (Scramdisk).
<LI>/password3 or /p3 - specifies the password to be used with the volume in /v (Scramdisk).
<LI>/password4 or /p4 - specifies the password to be used with the volume in /v (Scramdisk).
<LI>/auto or /a  - automatically executes the mount if enough parameters have been provided.
<LI>/cache or /c - with a value of Y or N, enables or disables the password cache.
<LI>/history or /h - with a value of Y or N, enables or disables the history.
<LI>/wipecache or /wc - wipes any currently stored passwords in the drivers memory.</UL>
<P>The syntax of the command line is:</P>
<P>volmount [/v volume] [/sd] [/l letter] [/e] [/b] [/p password] etc</P>
<P>Whitespace between parameters, and parameter values does not matter.</P>
<P>The order of the parameters does not matter.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Turning off the cache will not clear the password cache, use both /c and /wc to turn the cache off, and clear it.
<HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left"></P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Unmounting a Volume">7. Unmounting a Volume</A></H1>
<P>The concept of &quot;unmounting a volume&quot; means to take away the operating systems knowledge of your encrypted disk.</P>
<P>To unmount a volume, you will need to click on the icon &quot;Unmount Volume&quot;. This will start the program &quot;volmount&quot;.</P>
<P>You should see the following window.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="unmount.gif"></P>
<P>This window has the following elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tree view - which contains all of the driver letters available on your system, including the driver letters which have an encrypted volume attached to them, in addition to free drive letters. Used or &quot;mounted&quot; driver letters will show the full path and filename of the file hosted volume or partition based volume that's attached to them.
<LI>Unmount button - this button will unmount a mounted driver letter.
<LI>Help - this button will open up the E4M help file.</UL>
<P>To unmount a volume first select a mounted volume, and then press the unmount button.</P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Changing a volumes password">8. Changing a volumes password</A></H1>
<P>To change a volumes password, you will need to follow the steps for mounting a volume, but instead of pressing the mount button, press the change password button. This will prompt you with the Password Change window.</P>
<P>This window has the following elements:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Old Password box - this is the field into which you must type the volumes old password.
<LI>New Password box - here type in the new password you want to assign to the volume.
<LI>Verify Password box - in order to make sure you don’t loose access to your data, the system requires that you enter your new password twice. Enter the second copy here.
<LI>Change button - this button will change your volumes password. If you have used the wrong password for the volume, or the volume is not an E4M volume, the system will complain.</UL>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="Dumping a volumes contents using &quot;voltest&quot;">9. Dumping a volumes contents using &quot;voltest&quot;</A></H1>
<P>To dump a volumes contents you can use the command line only tool &quot;voltest&quot;.</P>
<P>This program accepts the following parameters:</P>
<UL><UL>
<LI>v volume
<LI>t
<LI>s secNumber
<LI>c secCount
<LI>v specifies the file and path name of the volume to be dumped.
<LI>t specifies to test the volumes encryption/decryption support
<LI>s specifies which sector to start dumping from
<LI>c specifies the number of sectors to dump</UL></UL>
<P>This tool displays the contents of an E4M volume. It is a useful starting point to understanding how E4M volumes are structured, and in solving problems related to bad disk sectors, or other corruptions.</P>
<P>The tool also checks to make sure that the volumes sector encryption is working correctly.</P>
<P>This tool does not support Scramdisk.</P>
<P>This tool only supports file hosted volumes.</P>

<H1><A NAME="Support for Scramdisk, &amp; Scramdisk weaknesses">11. Support for Scramdisk, &amp; Scramdisk weaknesses</A></H1>
<P>Scramdisk support is provided for file hosted volumes, but not for raw partition volumes, or for &quot;WAV&quot; based volumes.</P>
<P>The Scramdisk information block (such as last access time) is not updated by E4M.</P>
<P>As E4M has more sophisticated Pkcs-5 key setting, and faster cipher implementations than Scramdisk, support for Scramdisk will be phased out when E4M supports Windows 95/98.</P>
<P>The length of Blowfish keys in Scramdisk is actually only 160 bits not 256 bits.</P>
<P>The length of Triple-DES keys in Scramdisk is actually only 140 bits not 168 bits.</P>
<P>This is because during the user password key setting stage of opening a volume, Scramdisk uses only 20 bytes worth of key material. The fact that the disk keys later use up to 32 bytes of key material is irrelevant because an attacker would simply brute force the first stage, and then recover the key for the second stage.</P>
<P>However there is no cause for concern. The ANSI standard for Triple-DES specifies only 112 bits.</P>
<P>Scramdisk does not record which particular cipher has encrypted a particular volume in an attempt to make a dictionary attack harder. This protection mechanism is weak because:</P>
<OL>
<LI>A dictionary of all possible Scramdisk passwords can easily be compiled because there is no key salt.
<LI>A user using the same password on more than one volume is vulnerable to a dictionary attack because his password will hash down to the same value for both volumes, thanks to the point above.
<LI>Many people will simply use the default cipher (Blowfish), making trying the dictionary using Blowfish the first point of attack, and the most likely to succeed.
<LI>Non-Blowfish users will most likely use either DES or IDEA, making these the second most likely ciphers to attack.</OL>
<P>E4M uses Pkcs-5 with a keysetup counter of 1000 and a key salt of 20 bytes. This results in a delay of a second or more to set a single key. An attacker using 140,000 word lower case dictionary would need to run a computer for a day continuously to recover the password.</P>
<P>If the password for one volume is recovered, and the same password is used on a second volume to which an attacker wants to break into, the second attack would still take another day, this is thanks to the key salt.</P>
<P>These attacks would be much quicker against a Scramdisk volume.</P>
<P><HR WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="Left">
<STRONG>Important: </STRONG>This emphasises the need to choose passwords wisely, try to select passwords with upper, and lower case characters, together with punctuation. A well chosen password is immune to this attack.

<H1><A NAME="E4M Volume Layout">12. E4M Volume Layout</A></H1>
<P>The E4M volume format is based on the format used by SFS with the following differences:</P>
<UL>
<LI>E4M does not create/use header #3. This header is the File System Information header. This is because rather than dynamically creating a boot sector when a volume is mounted (as SFS does), E4M stores the boot sector as sector #2 within the volume. This allows a E4M FAT volume to be reformatted to use NTFS.
<LI>E4M uses the volume ID tag &quot;E4M&quot; which is present in the first 3 bytes of all E4M format volumes. There is an extra 4th byte with is currently set to 0x20 (space). This byte is reserved for a future version number.
<LI>E4M does not use or support descriptive volume names; because Windows now has long filename support; this feature is not required.
<LI>E4M has an extra 16bit field for the Pkcs-5 flag.
<LI>E4M has a maximum disk key length of 288 bytes, although the largest key length supported at the moment is 32 byte Blowfish (256 bits).</UL>
